The skyrocketing development of humankind comes largely thanks to its capacity to produce, to stock and to use energy in order to accomplish things impossible for the body alone.

So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it.

In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising. One need to consume more, to grow faster and it's not without additional energy\nbut also additional pollution Meanwhile, temperatures and oceans are rising\nbiodiversity is shrinking and even if we're still looking a infinite, non-polluting form of energy we're realizing that it won't exist and that we are in big train which is speeding up into the wall of extinction. \u201cIt is my professional opinion that now is the time to PANIC.\u201d This is Boo. Boo is a child and like Nutella once said in a french ad Children needs energy. In other words, a child contains energy. Thus one might consider exploiting children as a energy source.

We're working for a better tomorrow, today ! We're Monsters, Incorporated, we scare because we care. \u2026 producing electricity with children's screams \u2026 ... ok why not. (On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field. It may sound a bit highbrow but piezoelectrics are very common and we can find them in a variety of daily-life objects.

Firstly, beyond lighters, it's already used for sound systems such as mics and speakers, but very very thin. It seems relevant for our problem: we just have to cover the door with some piezo overlay and we would have our energy converter. The other advantage is that, the energy collection is integrated in the door, it could power itself ! Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation. I'm sorry this conclusion is a bit funk depression. Wait no I meant full depression ... What am I saying ? funk depression? ... funk dep... funk depression! We screwed the planet!
