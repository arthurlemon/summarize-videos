these\u00a0\ntutorial videos in this video i'm gonna teach you\u00a0\u00a0 hopefully uh 20 tricks that you didn't know that\u00a0\nany climbers should know i guess so it's going\u00a0\u00a0 to be i'm going to go through them really quickly\u00a0\nif you guys have any like if you want me to go in\u00a0\u00a0 depth on some of them please comment below maybe\u00a0\ni can make a like a specific video on a specific\u00a0\u00a0 uh subject it's 20 tips and tricks so that's\u00a0\nkind of a lot um so i'm just going to jump in\u00a0\u00a0 the first tip is back in the days 20 years\u00a0\nago when i started climbing this was only\u00a0\u00a0 for the professionals i remember\u00a0\nall the professionals used a camera\u00a0\u00a0 a film camera not like this this is an iphone but\u00a0\nuh like a big chunky camera to study the technique\u00a0\u00a0 nowadays we all have a cell phone and i\u00a0\nthink filming yourself is not only good for\u00a0\u00a0 posting on instagram or on youtube\u00a0\nbut also to analyze your technique\u00a0\u00a0 trying to figure out what you can do better and i\u00a0\nthink a lot of you if you haven't filmed yourself\u00a0\u00a0 climbing it's often like completely different from\u00a0\nhow you you think you're climbing uh the next step\u00a0\u00a0 is to clean your shoes from chalk there's a\u00a0\nlot of chalk in the gym when we walk around\u00a0\u00a0 if you look underneath the sole of your shoe after\u00a0\na while it's probably going to be completely white\u00a0\u00a0 chalk makes our skin really sticky but not the\u00a0\nrubber on our shoes so make sure that you clean\u00a0\u00a0 your shoes i would say the only exception is\u00a0\nwhen uh your shoe is wet then sometimes it\u00a0\u00a0 could be good to to dry it up with a little bit of\u00a0\nchalk but otherwise try to keep your your shoes as\u00a0\u00a0 chalk free as possible don't over grip or re-grip\u00a0\ntoo much you see a lot of especially beginners\u00a0\u00a0 when after they grab a hole they adjust it they\u00a0\nkind of jank it to to get it a little bit better\u00a0\u00a0 but i think in most cases it's better to just\u00a0\ngrab it maybe adjust it one time and then move on\u00a0\u00a0 climbing faster i consider myself a pretty fast\u00a0\nclimber but i feel like me included i can also\u00a0\u00a0 climb a lot faster i try to tell myself to climb\u00a0\nfaster when i look at people like Adam Ondra and sometimes when you climb fast it's hard to\u00a0\nto climb everything technically perfect but if\u00a0\u00a0 you put up like a side by side comparison you try\u00a0\nto climb a bowler perfectly and you're trying to\u00a0\u00a0 just climb it as fast as possible i think often\u00a0\nclimbing it just as fast as possible will feel\u00a0\u00a0 easier because you spend less time on the wall but\u00a0\nthe the best thing is obviously if you can do both\u00a0\u00a0 like you climb it perfectly and you climb it fast\u00a0\nlike perfect technique and fast but that's really\u00a0\u00a0 hard to do so if i had to choose between the two\u00a0\ni would just climb uh fast when i started climbing\u00a0\u00a0 everything was about climbing as nicely\u00a0\nas possible doing a lot of drop knees\u00a0\u00a0 and trying to stay as close to the wall\u00a0\ndoing everything really controlled but\u00a0\u00a0 i feel like the new school technique is to just\u00a0\nrely more on power and try to climb things quicker next tip is something that you probably\u00a0\nheard from your climbing coach or whatever\u00a0\u00a0 a million times climb with straight arms\u00a0\nit's super awkward that's much easier i also think that when your fingers get stronger\u00a0\nit's easier to climb on a straight arm because you\u00a0\u00a0 feel more in control so you can let down uh let\u00a0\nyourself down on a straight arm in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0 it feels very unsecure because you don't know\u00a0\nhow much strength you have in the fingers and\u00a0\u00a0 your natural reaction will be to like\u00a0\nkind of bend your arms a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 even on moves like dinos and stuff\u00a0\nit's often beneficial to keep your\u00a0\u00a0 arms as straight as possible next step waving\u00a0\nyour hands like this you always want dry as\u00a0\u00a0 dry not as dry as possible but you always want\u00a0\ndry skin so especially if it's hot you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 climbers do this so you kind of wave your arms\u00a0\nand you turn or twist the arm halfway so that you\u00a0\u00a0 kind of get as much air as possible you spread\u00a0\nyour fingers out and they will feel a lot drier\u00a0\u00a0 another thing that might keep your fingers dry\u00a0\nis liquid chalk i don't like using liquid chalk\u00a0\u00a0 i think it makes it too dry and i also think\u00a0\nthat it wears out my skin quicker if i use\u00a0\u00a0 liquid shocks so i personally don't like liquid\u00a0\nchalk but that i mean that's for you to decide\u00a0\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to try it at least and\u00a0\nsee if they like it i have found out that i don't\u00a0\u00a0 like it taking care of your skin this is something\u00a0\nthat i could make an entire video on most climbers\u00a0\u00a0 are really obsessed with their skin you'll\u00a0\nsee climbers look down at their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kind of try to figure out how much climbing\u00a0\nis they have left based on how good their skin is\u00a0\u00a0 there's a lot of things you can do sandpapering\u00a0\nthe skin is is very popular also make sure that\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "In this section,

use\u00a0\nsmall blades to cut off like flakes of skin it's\u00a0\u00a0 all about keeping the skin as even as possible\u00a0\nto make it grow as fast as possible so if it's\u00a0\u00a0 uneven you try to sandpaper down the thick parts\u00a0\nso that everything can grow sometimes i also use\u00a0\u00a0 something called the antihydrol it's a thing\u00a0\nthat i order from germany i don't know how\u00a0\u00a0 healthy that is so i'm not going to recommend\u00a0\nit to any of you guys but there and there's\u00a0\u00a0 also things like rhino skin and i know there's a\u00a0\nlot of other products as well to keep your skin\u00a0\u00a0 dry and dry skin will not wear out as quickly as\u00a0\nuh as wet skin so trying to keep your skin as dry\u00a0\u00a0 as possible while climbing will also make it uh\u00a0\nmore robust so you can climb for longer because i\u00a0\u00a0 feel like often that's what prevents us climbers\u00a0\nfrom climbing as much as we want is our skin\u00a0\u00a0 so trying having good skin care not for your\u00a0\nface but for your fingers is important i should\u00a0\u00a0 also mention that the type of holes that you're\u00a0\nclimbing on really matters when it comes to skin\u00a0\u00a0 like these holes are really rough and then you\u00a0\nhave some other holes that are really nice for the\u00a0\u00a0 skin and if you want to train for a longer time\u00a0\nyou should definitely choose the bowlers with uh\u00a0\u00a0 with with the holes that are not too rough for\u00a0\nthe skin i think it's also important to to know\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need a training program to become\u00a0\nbetter uh even among the top climbers the best\u00a0\u00a0 climbers in the world everyone trains really\u00a0\ndifferently so there's a lot of way to progress\u00a0\u00a0 and i think the best way as i've said before\u00a0\nis just to climb a lot and also to try really\u00a0\u00a0 hard when you when you climb tip number 10 is to\u00a0\nget a hang board you could also get a portable\u00a0\u00a0 hangboard we just released this it's on\u00a0\nrungne.com the link is in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh this you can either use uh separately like\u00a0\nthis you can use it as like sling training and\u00a0\u00a0 you have two different grips this way is a little\u00a0\nbit better this way is a little bit worse this\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously a jug and you can also attach them i\u00a0\nlove the sound it makes when you click it together\u00a0\u00a0 it has four points of attachment so when you put\u00a0\nit up and it's uh and it's not split up then it's\u00a0\u00a0 super super stable this way you also have a jug\u00a0\nhere uh and also this way the edge is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more negative so this is a little bit worse and\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of friction inside here too\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not uh it's not super slippery there's a\u00a0\nlot of techniques that climbers use and i think\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the beginning it's important to try\u00a0\nthem out even if you don't think they will work\u00a0\u00a0 just like drop knees knee bars flagging toe hook\u00a0\nkey hook bicycle pogoing i mean just try out a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of different things because it's always hard\u00a0\nto know what technique to apply to a new problem\u00a0\u00a0 if you haven't climbed it before and i think just\u00a0\nlike instinctively uh realizing what you have\u00a0\u00a0 to do it just comes with practice but the more\u00a0\nyou try different things like techniques in the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning the easier it's gonna get to immediately\u00a0\nknow what technique uh to use on a on a new\u00a0\u00a0 problem it's better to try one hundred percent\u00a0\none time than to try fifty percent two times i\u00a0\u00a0 always go for high quality you have to try really\u00a0\nhard and fail that's the only way that the body\u00a0\u00a0 is gonna improve and become stronger and for high\u00a0\nquality you also you can't be afraid of failing\u00a0\u00a0 in the gym um i know it's uh for me included\u00a0\nit's sometimes you feel like people watching you\u00a0\u00a0 uh you're afraid of making of looking dumb and\u00a0\nfailing in public the gyms are really crowded\u00a0\u00a0 everyone's watching but i think it's important\u00a0\nnot to care too much about failing i mean failing\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely part of any climber's process if\u00a0\nyou don't fail you don't try hard enough for\u00a0\u00a0 most climbers failing is like 90 percent and maybe\u00a0\nnot for Alex Honnold because he's free soloing so\u00a0\u00a0 uh he can't fail but for the rest of us\u00a0\nfailing is definitely a big part of climbing\u00a0\u00a0 okay the next tip is to find a shoe that fits you\u00a0\nreally well and the best way to do that is go to\u00a0\u00a0 like a shoe demo or go to a climbing shop that has\u00a0\nlike a little climbing wall or somewhere where you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out the shoes uh because the shoe will\u00a0\nfeel very different when you put it on and when\u00a0\u00a0 you're actually climbing with it when you put\u00a0\nlike pressure on the different parts of the shoe\u00a0\u00a0 so make sure that you can actually try out\u00a0\nthe shoes before deciding on a shoe and we\u00a0\u00a0 all have like our feet are very different so it's\u00a0\nimportant that you find a shoe that fits your foot\u00a0\u00a0 so if i tell you that a shoe is really good for me\u00a0\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's good for you\u00a0\u00a0 but there are definitely some good and some bad\u00a0\nshoes out there okay the next uh tip is also a\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "In this section, the speaker gives tips for maintaining and improving climbing skills, including moisturizing and taking care of the skin, using specific products to keep the skin dry, and choosing the right type of climbing holes. The speaker also recommends trying out different techniques and not being afraid to fail in order to improve, as well as finding a shoe that fits well through trying them out at demos or climbing shops. The speaker also promotes a portable hangboard product and emphasizes the importance of climbing frequently and challenging oneself."}, {"start": 10.332, "end": 15.4147, "text": "climbing skin related tip it's to wash off the\u00a0\nchalk after climbing immediately because the skin\u00a0\u00a0 will not start growing until you get the chalk off\u00a0\nso make sure that you wash your hands immediately\u00a0\u00a0 after climbing so that the healing process of the\u00a0\nskin can start as quickly as possible okay so the\u00a0\u00a0 next tip is to make bowlers once in a while on\u00a0\na wall like the one behind me a case wall also\u00a0\u00a0 called a spray wall it's just full of holes and\u00a0\nyou decide what holes to use for your hands and\u00a0\u00a0 for your feet i think it's very good for memory\u00a0\nbut also to understand how to move on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 and how root setters think you know it's it's\u00a0\nnot only the size of the holes and the distance\u00a0\u00a0 between holes that make a roller hard it's more\u00a0\ncomplex than that and i think making bowlers on\u00a0\u00a0 a wall like this will give you a much better\u00a0\nunderstanding of not only how the roots are\u00a0\u00a0 think but also just how the body works and how\u00a0\nlike different moves work so definitely encourage\u00a0\u00a0 everyone to to do this once in a while it's\u00a0\nprobably not as fun as like regular baldering just\u00a0\u00a0 walking around having a lot of preset bowlers it's\u00a0\nkind of a everything back in the days everything\u00a0\u00a0 used to be like this ever like you you had to\u00a0\nmake your own problems with friends uh you had\u00a0\u00a0 to remember those problems for the next session\u00a0\nbut nowadays uh everything is just preset in\u00a0\u00a0 colors on big walls that they change out\u00a0\noften my next step is to train more core\u00a0\u00a0 i think a lot of us we kind of stop training when\u00a0\nour skin and fingers and arms feel worked it feels\u00a0\u00a0 like you can't climb anymore but i think training\u00a0\na little bit more core after that because core is\u00a0\u00a0 just completely different you can train a lot more\u00a0\ncore even when your fingers and arms are finished\u00a0\u00a0 so training more core at the end of the session\u00a0\ni think would benefit any climber uh the next tip\u00a0\u00a0 probably comes as a surprise to most of you but\u00a0\nit's to warm up i i joke about this but i feel bad\u00a0\u00a0 for joking about it it's also very personal\u00a0\nhow much warming up your body needs but i think\u00a0\u00a0 you should definitely warm up for 20 minutes to\u00a0\nhalf an hour to to just prevent injuries and to\u00a0\u00a0 also get your body ready to just pull really hard\u00a0\ni've always been really bad at warming up and it's\u00a0\u00a0 definitely something that i should become better\u00a0\nat now that i'm getting older definitely warm up\u00a0\u00a0 find a routine that works for you there's a lot of\u00a0\ntutorials on this on on youtube but again i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's important to find a warm-up routine that\u00a0\nworks for you it's i think in general training and\u00a0\u00a0 also dieting and everything it's it's a lot more\u00a0\npersonal than we think so um you should always\u00a0\u00a0 try to find a thing experiment a little bit and\u00a0\ntry to find things that work for you not listen\u00a0\u00a0 blindly to what other people have to say um\u00a0\nthe next thing is dieting it's something that\u00a0\u00a0 i haven't talked so much about on this channel\u00a0\nbut of course weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 unfortunately i would say because i don't know\u00a0\nit's something that a lot of climbers struggle\u00a0\u00a0 with and i feel like sometimes losing weight\u00a0\nuh is like a short-term solution it's uh it's\u00a0\u00a0 like a shortcut i don't know i would not encourage\u00a0\nanyone to to really go on a diet if it's not for\u00a0\u00a0 for health reasons right now i'm trying to\u00a0\nactually gain a little bit of weight because\u00a0\u00a0 i i was a little bit lighter and i don't\u00a0\nknow i feel like my mood and everything my\u00a0\u00a0 like the quality of life goes down and for me\u00a0\nit's not worth it now that i'm not a professional\u00a0\u00a0 anymore it's definitely if you have a weight\u00a0\nto lose and you feel like you can do it in a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy way then then it's it could be a good\u00a0\nthing because weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 but at the same time i would also uh warn\u00a0\nyou against like dieting too hard and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a rabbit hole that a lot of people\u00a0\na lot of climbers uh fall into and never get out\u00a0\u00a0 of so like a lot of climbers have problems with\u00a0\neating disorders i've had it as well uh in my\u00a0\u00a0 in my youth and uh i would also encourage\u00a0\npeople to to look around and try to try to see\u00a0\u00a0 uh try to help other people with eating disorders\u00a0\nbecause it's a serious problem in climbing and\u00a0\u00a0 not only in climbing but everywhere right now and\u00a0\nuh yeah so that's why i don't want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 uh too much about like dieting and food and\u00a0\neating tips and stuff on this channel because\u00a0\u00a0 i'm not a an expert when it comes to that\u00a0\nand yeah i know how how dangerous it can be\u00a0\u00a0 so so the next tip is to not respect higher grades\u00a0\ni think a lot of people have too much respect they\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "In this

Well, I'm not really teaching you anything, this is not news. The skyrocketing development of humankind comes largely thanks to its capacity to produce, to stock and to use energy in order to accomplish things impossible for the body alone. And nowadays, when one speak about \"access to energy\", one talks about this gesture. One simple gesture which grants everyone electricity, powering the majority of the devices around us including the ones used to make this video or to allow you to look at it while you're on the toilet. Yes but where does electricty comes from ? Because we didn't answer anythi... Well ! We can indeed ask ourself this question given the fact that \"natural\" electricity is \nextremely rare and instable just like lightning for example. What am I doing here ? (This is the old set of an famous french tv show about science) Ha ! That's better (This is the classic set of the channel, black bg) ! So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising. One need to consume more, to grow faster and it's not without additional energy\nbut also additional pollution Meanwhile, temperatures and oceans are rising\nbiodiversity is shrinking and even if we're still looking a infinite, non-polluting form of energy we're realizing that it won't exist and that we are in big train which is speeding up into the wall of extinction. \u201cIt is my professional opinion that now is the time to PANIC.\u201d This is Boo. Boo is a child and like Nutella once said in a french ad Children needs energy. In other words, a child contains energy. Thus one might consider exploiting children as a energy source. And of course, those people are monsters ... I mean litteraly. The future is bright at Monsters, Inc! We power your car, we warm your home, we light your city! Warefuly matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream. Refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on, Monsters, Inc is there. We're working for a better tomorrow, today ! We're Monsters, Incorporated, we scare because we care. \u2026 producing electricity with children's screams \u2026 ... ok why not. (On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field. It may sound a bit highbrow but piezoelectrics are very common and we can find them in a variety of daily-life objects. For example:", "summary": "In this section, the video discusses the need for energy and the various sources of energy that can be converted into electrical energy. However, the demand for energy is still increasing, leading to additional pollution and environmental issues. The video then humorously suggests using children as an energy source, before delving into the science of sound and how it can be converted into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials. Piezoelectric materials generate an electrical charge when a mechanical force is applied to them and are commonly found in daily-life objects."}, {"start": 5.1567, "end": 10.1763, "text": "An individual finds himself facing a satanic symbol.\n(This is the logo of a really shitty but succesful tv show in France) Then, he grabs his piezo lighter in his pocket. By pushing the button, he compresses the piezo crystal hidden inside, creating a electrical surcharge dissipated as a small spark, lighting up the flame. Armed qith the malicious power of fire, the man can burn the evil on this land and make the world a better place. Same thing for a gas cooker ! I like the piezoelectric theory for several reasons. Firstly, beyond lighters, it's already used for sound systems such as mics and speakers, but very very thin. It seems relevant for our problem: we just have to cover the door with some piezo overlay and we would have our energy converter. The other advantage is that, the energy collection is integrated in the door, it could power itself ! Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation. I'm sorry this conclusion is a bit funk depression. Wait no I meant full depression ... What am I saying ? funk depression? ... funk dep... funk depression! We screwed the planet! Far right politicians going strong all over the world ... Future nice vibes at the frontier! I love water, in 20 years it will be gone.

Julie and thank you everyone for having me today so it's great to see you I've been doing a lot of talking about you so just actually talk with you because I'm sort of on a book tour now but first off where are you staying most critically I am staying in Airbnb in Harlem on I think it's near 125th Street it's with these two hosts Matt and Gina they are interior designers and so it's like it's a brownstone you walk up and actually it's really cool because they travel a lot themselves and they try to pick up something every place they travel and they bring it back and so they've got like these saddles from they went horseback riding so it's a really cool experience and of course they're moms here are my girlfriend's here so we got to cook food last night in the house great so glad yeah and sometimes we do these things in hotels but here we're not yeah it's often that you and I have conversations at a banquet room in a hotel is how I usually gets interviewed in hotel yeah so it goes so there's so much I want to talk to you that absolutely um but before we do that I think a lot of people in the room I certainly am very gently with your story but I think a lot of people may not be familiar with just your your the story of your origin so I just want to briefly touch on how you came up with this idea the sort of the origin story kind of share that with us a little bit yeah probably the probably begins of my mom I guess I guess all origin stories start with your mom so you know growing up I grew up in Albany New York so I actually think of myself more as a New Yorker was for 18 19 years and my parents are both social workers growing up and you know my mom I remember my mom giving me advice when I grew up she said you know Brian your father and I we chose a job because we loved it but we didn't really get paid a lot so you should choose a job with money and so like it was very obvious it's so like we're looking at like what jobs pay a lot of money and so one day I told my mom like you know I think I'm going I'm going to go to the Rhode Island School design I'm going to become an artist at which point she said you somehow managed to pick the only job in the world that pays less than a social worker you'll get paid nothing and I said I'll make an income I'll get a job I promise she said well I do want you to promise me that you get a job at that job has health insurance one day and so this was the kind of beginning of my endeavor I went to risky and was totally different because at RISD everyone was making stuff they were like they embraced entrepreneurship and I graduate RISD I get this job to health insurance I'm living in LA but one of my best friends are risky with the sky the name Joe Gebbia and Joe Gabby and I were like these kind of entrepreneurial people on campus and like we both started sports teams at resort school that's the hardest marketing job in the world get an artist to come to a sports game and Joe lives in San Francisco at this point this is by 2007 and he's trying to get me to come to San Francisco I think Brian come to San Francisco we're going to start a company together we're gonna start a company together and I'm like having this job in LA and I remember at one point my life was like I was in a car and the roads probably looked exactly like the road behind me and that kind of terrified me and I wanted to take a detour so I had this moment I'm sure all of us have these moments in our life where we make a change and everything changes after that I quit my job and I put everything I have a old Honda Civic I put everything I owned and the back seat and the trunk of old Honda Civic including a rolled-up foam mattress I have a thousand dollars a bank and I called Joe and I said I'm coming to San Francisco and you know it turns out that Joe said well the rent is $1,150 so I actually can't pay rent it turns out that weekend this international sign conference is coming to san francisco all the hotels a hotel you go to the conference website all the hotels and the conference website are sold out as we had this idea we said well what if we just turned our house into a bed and breakfast for design conference unfortunately I'm having the bed but Joe had three air beds we pulled the air beds out of the closet we inflated three our beds we called it the air bed and breakfast yeah I love that noise um and yeah so that's how I started to air bed and breakfast calm so I guess the answer is no when I start every bite comment a guide B is the New York Stock Exchange and I'm hosting three people of 35 rooms and boss from the third girl from India a 45-year of 505 from Utah but what ended up happening with the end up becoming friends and we made enough money pay a rent at this point we say you know we're ordinary guys I bet you the thought or they're ordinary people like us who want to make some extra money be cool people I asked show I said well who's the best engineer you know just said well my old roommate natives and so three of us got together and we had a simple idea what if you can book someone's own the blue you could book a hotel anywhere in the

you know what everybody is because there's still some times with that okay anyone ever stayed in their views did anyone's kids staying there baby I usually get one before we get on to other stuff there's one thing that really surprised we have a whole story that you don't often hear about is how hard it was for you guys once you decided to this was going to be your idea to get it off the ground right people fled and ran away from this idea people thought this was crazy we were trying to in summer of 2008 I a I meet a guy named Michael Seibel and Michael Seibel says there's these people called angels and they'll give you money and the first thing I thought is I can't believe this guy believes an angel that's how naive I was and he introduced us to about 20 angel investors and a couple venture capitalists but at that point we were trying to raise 150 thousand dollars at a 1.5 million dollar valuation so we already tried this million with an M yeah so 10% of company and 20 probably got 20 introductions about 10 to 12 or 13 probably didn't meet us you've probably met a half dozen people people mostly ran away from the LPO everyone ran away from idea no one funded us I guess three three reasons or two reasons the first reason was Joe and I or designers and the far as they were concerned designers didn't start company it's like look like a tech founder which i think is ridiculous because I don't think you should ever hire some because they look like something else like you want a new thing well maybe they look different but everyone was looking for either at the Zuckerberg Harvard computer drop out of Harvard or didn't drop out of a ph.d program at Stanford well you weren't going to be the next Google or Facebook and the point was well liked the previous tech company founders didn't drop out of Stanford so it was a little absurd but the bigger issue was people asked well first of all how many air beds are there in the world in fact when we were trying to do our first investor deck we had to create a total adjustable market and so the first thing we thought is well how many air bed cells are there and this is before we actually realized like because one day somebody said like I want to rent my whole I want my bedroom and I said well all you to do is get a mattress inflated and put on your mattress and I thought at some point we should open the model up but but the bigger problem was a simple idea people did not think strangers would stay with other strangers they thought it was crazy in fact I number written about this but a one person told me he said Brian I said yes I said he said I hope that's not the only idea working on and at some point in late 2008 one of the investors told us because the financial crisis hit and he goes listen that financial crisis is create is hit the stock market's cratering I can't even invest in good companies the young gonna invest in air beds and so that kind of hit home so we ended up not raising money and we ended up providing how like we say we did the visa rounds the joke Joe says which is basically we got their nose binders who put baseball cards in we did put credit cards in them so we probably each of us Rach I guess I think I racked up like $25,000 of credit card debt so we just you know until they stopped getting was credit cards and then late 2008 we provide housing for the Democratic National Convention in Denver and then we didn't make a lot of money with air beds so we thought well we can't sell money with air beds where air bed and breakfast let's go into the breakfast business so we took a weird detour and we ended up making collectible breakfast cereal Barack Obama themed breakfast cereal for the Democratic National Convention we took Cheerios we called it Obama of the breakfast of change and we had a John McCain scene scene serial captain McCain a maverick and every bite and we basically handmade like cereal box in our living room in 2008 made $30,000 selling collectible breakfast cereal and this is actually how he funded the company at late 2008 my mom asked are you a cereal company now in the people I know how to answer her no because technically we were actually that's where we made multi revenue and so at some point I'm like well cereal seems like a good business for now but I want to have a cereal company and so you know that was those were kind of the dark times so what's the lesson in there for other entrepreneurs well I think there's two things I mean first of all I you know a lot of entrepreneurs meet me and they say I need to have investors I need to raise capital and I think like we were the first round we raised was $20,000 of capital like that was the first round we eventually raised I think that startups today are over capitalized I mean easy for me to say now but like things get expensive with scale but you don't need millions of dollars to start an idea and actually we almost have a rule that you unless you have fixed cost like you're in the hardware you have fixed costs ideally you don't need any capital to create a prototype ideally your", "summary": "In this section, Brian Chesky, co-founder of

can create the product themselves but there's a bigger lesson there which is this I think we just didn't quit and I think a lot of people who try to do what we did or try to do other things they quit they stopped short and a lot of people ask well why didn't you quit and the reason we didn't quit is if you start a company very simply you have to know something no one else knows about your business otherwise why are you doing it and why doesn't already exist so the big question is what do you know that no one else knows about your business you need to have a unique insight and we had a very simple unique insight it was totally by happenstance in other words we randomly rented her home one weekend and so our unique insight was it's actually not weird for stranger to stay of those strangers and you can make a bunch of money and the people who travel there can save money have an amazing experience if people could just experience what we experienced that one weekend this would be an idea that would spread on the world and again maybe thousands of people one day would use Airbnb and that was our you insight and so that was kind of on our star and so we just kept thinking to that first week and that's why we kept going so you've spread very fast very far and wide but that's sort of when the you know hasn't been easy because as soon as you started to get a sizable sighs you know all the opposition started come out and we became disrupter then you became disruptors but you which I was growing up and that wasn't a good thing I was always in principle okay you don't like that word but it is you are sort of exhibit a of disruption that if you talk about a little later but you know your end user likes you that's very clear but many other stakeholders have not and and that's because if I the core business of renting out a home for short term violates local laws in many markets and you've work to turn those over in many many places but there are some markets that just won't budge and New York is one of them this has been a big source of opposition for you so talk about that a little bit why has there been so much pushback and what's the endgame yeah so maybe to back up for a second when I went to RISD and we design products before I got to RISD good design was if somebody used the product liked it and then I got too risky suddenly there was this thing called green design sustainability and the idea was it can't just be your product people like your product it has to be good for the world and so we call these externalities so it's good I'm not just guessing hope when we started Airbnb we didn't have a million people doing this so I did not consider landlords I didn't consider cities I was it would have been it was so bigger than what our idea was our idea was just to bring two people together it grew so fast and I came from the school thought like Craigslist that the communities and immune system and that people would get written from the site by the review system and I think a few years in it became very clear that we had to be much more mindful of how we designed the platform and we hired some great people one of the people we hired early on who had a huge influence me with Linda Johnson she's our chief business affairs and legal officer and she's a lawyer by training and she told me something very simple see growing up I felt like if people didn't like you you kind of stay away from them because like you're going to get in the fight and that's really bad and she said if you have to meet with people you have to meet with cities and even if they don't like you if they hear your story and you hear their story we can come to resolution you have to partner with cities we decided that we would have a principle that we would partner with cities now it didn't go totally smoothly and I wish it was much easier here in New York City but we started meeting cities city by city over the period of time what we've been able to accomplish I'll say this and I'll get to New York in a second is we now have agreements with 200 cities in the world we collect during the hotel tax we have typically regulatory schemes those regulatory schemes often involve a registration and they have some you know like I just came from London London has their own scheme where if you rent your entire home it's limited to 90 days so you don't take housing off the market you can rent bedrooms and every city's got a different process in New York City I think there were a number of things going on I think the first thing is that we were slow to be here I think we didn't get our story out early so it was a bit of misinformation about who our company was but I also think there's some substantive problems there was a phenomenon that occurred where landlords decided you can make a lot of money by taking units off the market and just renting them on a short-term basis and though I think the scope of was overstayed in our platform this was a real problem and people were doing this and I would consider to be a very bad negative externality so we were a little behind in this and we've had to play catch-up and so in New York City we've done a number of things we've made clear we want to pay collect and remit hotel tax like we do in San Francisco and Chicago and all these cities around the world we want to live a host to one

much more tight around people understand the rules regulations of their city and their building and to skit I think get a bit more hands-on and so you have to do these like kind of counterintuitive things and it's what Jeff Bezos did this is a Steve Jobs did this is what Walt Disney did I mean what was he bet me entire company on Disneyland it seems obvious today and he took the very best animators in the studio was really angry so one of the things that's interesting to me about this move for you is that your first product the way that Airbnb would create it and became viral and became huge was almost by accident I don't have to say what I didn't think was going to work and lo and behold it was transformative yes and so now you have kind of the opposite of that where you spent the past few years sort of developing this product in in the Airbnb lab and now released it onto the marketplace this is what we made for you so how is that better or worse or just different I say different unclear if it's better or worse I think there was a element of luck involved with the founding of the company I mean I'm we're lucky that we chose home first and not like if we chose chips or experiences first it wouldn't have worked because you need demand and people aren't searching for experiences they're searching for places to stay so it was better as an add-on to start the major thing is that you launch you get a lot of user feedback so I don't think it I think both are fine like Amazon Apple they all were very intentional about their second third fourth product everyone's first product was totally by accident for the most part so that I don't find that being defining factor I think the key is do you put the best people on it or really talented people does the CEO spend more of their energy on the new stuff not the mature stuff which i think is important and are you constantly testing and the other thing is a lot of one of the reason companies fail is a great story of why did like California Adventure not succeed in Disney for Disney so Disneyland expertise we had this thing called California venture it's actually now doing pretty well but initially was a huge failure and the reason was a huge failure was there was like 50 executives who went to an off-site and they were basically trying to figure out what a new park so look like they basically violated most laws of how to build a great product they realize well actually we make a lot more money on food and beverage than rides so we're going to have way more restaurants we're going to serve alcohol so parents can drink we're going to do a California theme park in California even though most people visit from California so it was basically created in a business plan it was actually amazing physically my only problem funeral want it and so then they had to basically redo the park with a multi-billion dollar renovation a lot of products fail because they start as business plans and the problem is the only thing that really matters that people want it and your customers do not care that you're successful sacrament they do not want you to be too successful because they want to know that they got the value and so I think the key thing is are you making something that people want and if you're starting it because it's a good revenue generator like well your customer doesn't care about that and so might be great business but not if no one uses it we're almost out of time I just have one more question I talked about your future and in in the book and say that your 10-year goal is to be the first online travel company to reach a hundred billion dollars in market value is that right no I mean I I think a market cap goal is not a great goal I think I think a different goal would be this you know we've completely changed we've given we've created a whole new category of how to stay and so now we've had 160 million people from every country of the world but North Korea Iran Syria Cuba in Syria stops today and the Kamiya so 191 countries are now living together and it's 2 million people over New Year's and pretty soon that will be every night so that's what we've already done I want to in the next 10 years get to this place where we can sell end to end trips that we can have hundreds and millions of people every year booking end to end experiences we are the home might be a minority of what we're doing we've completely changed what to do ten years from now is Friday night Saturday night you like what's fun to do around here weather did you live in or to you're traveling you'd look to Airbnb we've created tens of millions of entrepreneurs that are creating experiences a whole new part of the economy which is experience based economy and then we've all - gone - aviation and started to redefine how we fly because what if", "summary": "In this section, Airbnb CEO talks about their approach to regulating home-sharing and their new \"friendly neighbor landlord program.\" He also discusses the importance of putting the best people on new projects and constantly testing.
