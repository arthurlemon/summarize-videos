that you didn't know that\u00a0\nany climbers should know i guess so it's going\u00a0\u00a0 to be i'm going to go through them really quickly\u00a0\nif you guys have any like if you want me to go in\u00a0\u00a0 depth on some of them please comment below maybe\u00a0\ni can make a like a specific video on a specific\u00a0\u00a0 uh subject it's 20 tips and tricks so that's\u00a0\nkind of a lot um so i'm just going to jump in\u00a0\u00a0 the first tip is back in the days 20 years\u00a0\nago when i started climbing this was only\u00a0\u00a0 for the professionals i remember\u00a0\nall the professionals used a camera\u00a0\u00a0 a film camera not like this this is an iphone but\u00a0\nuh like a big chunky camera to study the technique\u00a0\u00a0 nowadays we all have a cell phone and i\u00a0\nthink filming yourself is not only good for\u00a0\u00a0 posting on instagram or on youtube\u00a0\nbut also to analyze your technique\u00a0\u00a0 trying to figure out what you can do better and i\u00a0\nthink a lot of you if you haven't filmed yourself\u00a0\u00a0 climbing it's often like completely different from\u00a0\nhow you you think you're climbing uh the next step\u00a0\u00a0 is to clean your shoes from chalk there's a\u00a0\nlot of chalk in the gym when we walk around\u00a0\u00a0 if you look underneath the sole of your shoe after\u00a0\na while it's probably going to be completely white\u00a0\u00a0 chalk makes our skin really sticky but not the\u00a0\nrubber on our shoes so make sure that you clean\u00a0\u00a0 your shoes i would say the only exception is\u00a0\nwhen uh your shoe is wet then sometimes it\u00a0\u00a0 could be good to to dry it up with a little bit of\u00a0\nchalk but otherwise try to keep your your shoes as\u00a0\u00a0 chalk free as possible don't over grip or re-grip\u00a0\ntoo much you see a lot of especially beginners\u00a0\u00a0 when after they grab a hole they adjust it they\u00a0\nkind of jank it to to get it a little bit better\u00a0\u00a0 but i think in most cases it's better to just\u00a0\ngrab it maybe adjust it one time and then move on\u00a0\u00a0 climbing faster i consider myself a pretty fast\u00a0\nclimber but i feel like me included i can also\u00a0\u00a0 climb a lot faster i try to tell myself to climb\u00a0\nfaster when i look at people like Adam Ondra and sometimes when you climb fast it's hard to\u00a0\nto climb everything technically perfect but if\u00a0\u00a0 you put up like a side by side comparison you try\u00a0\nto climb a bowler perfectly and you're trying to\u00a0\u00a0 just climb it as fast as possible i think often\u00a0\nclimbing it just as fast as possible will feel\u00a0\u00a0 easier because you spend less time on the wall but\u00a0\nthe the best thing is obviously if you can do both\u00a0\u00a0 like you climb it perfectly and you climb it fast\u00a0\nlike perfect technique and fast but that's really\u00a0\u00a0 hard to do so if i had to choose between the two\u00a0\ni would just climb uh fast when i started climbing\u00a0\u00a0 everything was about climbing as nicely\u00a0\nas possible doing a lot of drop knees\u00a0\u00a0 and trying to stay as close to the wall\u00a0\ndoing everything really controlled but\u00a0\u00a0 i feel like the new school technique is to just\u00a0\nrely more on power and try to climb things quicker next tip is something that you probably\u00a0\nheard from your climbing coach or whatever\u00a0\u00a0 a million times climb with straight arms\u00a0\nit's super awkward that's much easier i also think that when your fingers get stronger\u00a0\nit's easier to climb on a straight arm because you\u00a0\u00a0 feel more in control so you can let down uh let\u00a0\nyourself down on a straight arm in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0 it feels very unsecure because you don't know\u00a0\nhow much strength you have in the fingers and\u00a0\u00a0 your natural reaction will be to like\u00a0\nkind of bend your arms a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 even on moves like dinos and stuff\u00a0\nit's often beneficial to keep your\u00a0\u00a0 arms as straight as possible next step waving\u00a0\nyour hands like this you always want dry as\u00a0\u00a0 dry not as dry as possible but you always want\u00a0\ndry skin so especially if it's hot you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 climbers do this so you kind of wave your arms\u00a0\nand you turn or twist the arm halfway so that you\u00a0\u00a0 kind of get as much air as possible you spread\u00a0\nyour fingers out and they will feel a lot drier\u00a0\u00a0 another thing that might keep your fingers dry\u00a0\nis liquid chalk i don't like using liquid chalk\u00a0\u00a0 i think it makes it too dry and i also think\u00a0\nthat it wears out my skin quicker if i use\u00a0\u00a0 liquid shocks so i personally don't like liquid\u00a0\nchalk but that i mean that's for you to decide\u00a0\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to try it at least and\u00a0\nsee if they like it i have found out that i don't\u00a0\u00a0 like it taking care of your skin this is something\u00a0\nthat i could make an entire video on most climbers\u00a0\u00a0 are really obsessed with their skin you'll\u00a0\nsee climbers look down at their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kind of try to figure out how much climbing\u00a0\nis they have left based on how good their skin is\u00a0\u00a0 there's a lot of things you can do sandpapering\u00a0\nthe skin is is very popular also make sure that\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.252, "end": 10.332, "text": "you moisturize the skin a lot of climbers also use\u00a0\nsmall blades to cut off like flakes of skin it's\u00a0\u00a0 all about keeping the skin as even as possible\u00a0\nto make it grow as fast as possible so if it's\u00a0\u00a0 uneven you try to sandpaper down the thick parts\u00a0\nso that everything can grow sometimes i also use\u00a0\u00a0 something called the antihydrol it's a thing\u00a0\nthat i order from germany i don't know how\u00a0\u00a0 healthy that is so i'm not going to recommend\u00a0\nit to any of you guys but there and there's\u00a0\u00a0 also things like rhino skin and i know there's a\u00a0\nlot of other products as well to keep your skin\u00a0\u00a0 dry and dry skin will not wear out as quickly as\u00a0\nuh as wet skin so trying to keep your skin as dry\u00a0\u00a0 as possible while climbing will also make it uh\u00a0\nmore robust so you can climb for longer because i\u00a0\u00a0 feel like often that's what prevents us climbers\u00a0\nfrom climbing as much as we want is our skin\u00a0\u00a0 so trying having good skin care not for your\u00a0\nface but for your fingers is important i should\u00a0\u00a0 also mention that the type of holes that you're\u00a0\nclimbing on really matters when it comes to skin\u00a0\u00a0 like these holes are really rough and then you\u00a0\nhave some other holes that are really nice for the\u00a0\u00a0 skin and if you want to train for a longer time\u00a0\nyou should definitely choose the bowlers with uh\u00a0\u00a0 with with the holes that are not too rough for\u00a0\nthe skin i think it's also important to to know\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need a training program to become\u00a0\nbetter uh even among the top climbers the best\u00a0\u00a0 climbers in the world everyone trains really\u00a0\ndifferently so there's a lot of way to progress\u00a0\u00a0 and i think the best way as i've said before\u00a0\nis just to climb a lot and also to try really\u00a0\u00a0 hard when you when you climb tip number 10 is to\u00a0\nget a hang board you could also get a portable\u00a0\u00a0 hangboard we just released this it's on\u00a0\nrungne.com the link is in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh this you can either use uh separately like\u00a0\nthis you can use it as like sling training and\u00a0\u00a0 you have two different grips this way is a little\u00a0\nbit better this way is a little bit worse this\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously a jug and you can also attach them i\u00a0\nlove the sound it makes when you click it together\u00a0\u00a0 it has four points of attachment so when you put\u00a0\nit up and it's uh and it's not split up then it's\u00a0\u00a0 super super stable this way you also have a jug\u00a0\nhere uh and also this way the edge is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more negative so this is a little bit worse and\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of friction inside here too\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not uh it's not super slippery there's a\u00a0\nlot of techniques that climbers use and i think\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the beginning it's important to try\u00a0\nthem out even if you don't think they will work\u00a0\u00a0 just like drop knees knee bars flagging toe hook\u00a0\nkey hook bicycle pogoing i mean just try out a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of different things because it's always hard\u00a0\nto know what technique to apply to a new problem\u00a0\u00a0 if you haven't climbed it before and i think just\u00a0\nlike instinctively uh realizing what you have\u00a0\u00a0 to do it just comes with practice but the more\u00a0\nyou try different things like techniques in the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning the easier it's gonna get to immediately\u00a0\nknow what technique uh to use on a on a new\u00a0\u00a0 problem it's better to try one hundred percent\u00a0\none time than to try fifty percent two times i\u00a0\u00a0 always go for high quality you have to try really\u00a0\nhard and fail that's the only way that the body\u00a0\u00a0 is gonna improve and become stronger and for high\u00a0\nquality you also you can't be afraid of failing\u00a0\u00a0 in the gym um i know it's uh for me included\u00a0\nit's sometimes you feel like people watching you\u00a0\u00a0 uh you're afraid of making of looking dumb and\u00a0\nfailing in public the gyms are really crowded\u00a0\u00a0 everyone's watching but i think it's important\u00a0\nnot to care too much about failing i mean failing\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely part of any climber's process if\u00a0\nyou don't fail you don't try hard enough for\u00a0\u00a0 most climbers failing is like 90 percent and maybe\u00a0\nnot for Alex Honnold because he's free soloing so\u00a0\u00a0 uh he can't fail but for the rest of us\u00a0\nfailing is definitely a big part of climbing\u00a0\u00a0 okay the next tip is to find a shoe that fits you\u00a0\nreally well and the best way to do that is go to\u00a0\u00a0 like a shoe demo or go to a climbing shop that has\u00a0\nlike a little climbing wall or somewhere where you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out the shoes uh because the shoe will\u00a0\nfeel very different when you put it on and when\u00a0\u00a0 you're actually climbing with it when you put\u00a0\nlike pressure on the different parts of the shoe\u00a0\u00a0 so make sure that you can actually try out\u00a0\nthe shoes before deciding on a shoe and we\u00a0\u00a0 all have like our feet are very different so it's\u00a0\nimportant that you find a shoe that fits your foot\u00a0\u00a0 so if i tell you that a shoe is really good for me\u00a0\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's good for you\u00a0\u00a0 but there are definitely some good and some bad\u00a0\nshoes out there okay the next uh tip is also a\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 10.332, "end": 15.4147, "text": "climbing skin related tip it's to wash off the\u00a0\nchalk after climbing immediately because the skin\u00a0\u00a0 will not start growing until you get the chalk off\u00a0\nso make sure that you wash your hands immediately\u00a0\u00a0 after climbing so that the healing process of the\u00a0\nskin can start as quickly as possible okay so the\u00a0\u00a0 next tip is to make bowlers once in a while on\u00a0\na wall like the one behind me a case wall also\u00a0\u00a0 called a spray wall it's just full of holes and\u00a0\nyou decide what holes to use for your hands and\u00a0\u00a0 for your feet i think it's very good for memory\u00a0\nbut also to understand how to move on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 and how root setters think you know it's it's\u00a0\nnot only the size of the holes and the distance\u00a0\u00a0 between holes that make a roller hard it's more\u00a0\ncomplex than that and i think making bowlers on\u00a0\u00a0 a wall like this will give you a much better\u00a0\nunderstanding of not only how the roots are\u00a0\u00a0 think but also just how the body works and how\u00a0\nlike different moves work so definitely encourage\u00a0\u00a0 everyone to to do this once in a while it's\u00a0\nprobably not as fun as like regular baldering just\u00a0\u00a0 walking around having a lot of preset bowlers it's\u00a0\nkind of a everything back in the days everything\u00a0\u00a0 used to be like this ever like you you had to\u00a0\nmake your own problems with friends uh you had\u00a0\u00a0 to remember those problems for the next session\u00a0\nbut nowadays uh everything is just preset in\u00a0\u00a0 colors on big walls that they change out\u00a0\noften my next step is to train more core\u00a0\u00a0 i think a lot of us we kind of stop training when\u00a0\nour skin and fingers and arms feel worked it feels\u00a0\u00a0 like you can't climb anymore but i think training\u00a0\na little bit more core after that because core is\u00a0\u00a0 just completely different you can train a lot more\u00a0\ncore even when your fingers and arms are finished\u00a0\u00a0 so training more core at the end of the session\u00a0\ni think would benefit any climber uh the next tip\u00a0\u00a0 probably comes as a surprise to most of you but\u00a0\nit's to warm up i i joke about this but i feel bad\u00a0\u00a0 for joking about it it's also very personal\u00a0\nhow much warming up your body needs but i think\u00a0\u00a0 you should definitely warm up for 20 minutes to\u00a0\nhalf an hour to to just prevent injuries and to\u00a0\u00a0 also get your body ready to just pull really hard\u00a0\ni've always been really bad at warming up and it's\u00a0\u00a0 definitely something that i should become better\u00a0\nat now that i'm getting older definitely warm up\u00a0\u00a0 find a routine that works for you there's a lot of\u00a0\ntutorials on this on on youtube but again i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's important to find a warm-up routine that\u00a0\nworks for you it's i think in general training and\u00a0\u00a0 also dieting and everything it's it's a lot more\u00a0\npersonal than we think so um you should always\u00a0\u00a0 try to find a thing experiment a little bit and\u00a0\ntry to find things that work for you not listen\u00a0\u00a0 blindly to what other people have to say um\u00a0\nthe next thing is dieting it's something that\u00a0\u00a0 i haven't talked so much about on this channel\u00a0\nbut of course weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 unfortunately i would say because i don't know\u00a0\nit's something that a lot of climbers struggle\u00a0\u00a0 with and i feel like sometimes losing weight\u00a0\nuh is like a short-term solution it's uh it's\u00a0\u00a0 like a shortcut i don't know i would not encourage\u00a0\nanyone to to really go on a diet if it's not for\u00a0\u00a0 for health reasons right now i'm trying to\u00a0\nactually gain a little bit of weight because\u00a0\u00a0 i i was a little bit lighter and i don't\u00a0\nknow i feel like my mood and everything my\u00a0\u00a0 like the quality of life goes down and for me\u00a0\nit's not worth it now that i'm not a professional\u00a0\u00a0 anymore it's definitely if you have a weight\u00a0\nto lose and you feel like you can do it in a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy way then then it's it could be a good\u00a0\nthing because weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 but at the same time i would also uh warn\u00a0\nyou against like dieting too hard and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a rabbit hole that a lot of people\u00a0\na lot of climbers uh fall into and never get out\u00a0\u00a0 of so like a lot of climbers have problems with\u00a0\neating disorders i've had it as well uh in my\u00a0\u00a0 in my youth and uh i would also encourage\u00a0\npeople to to look around and try to try to see\u00a0\u00a0 uh try to help other people with eating disorders\u00a0\nbecause it's a serious problem in climbing and\u00a0\u00a0 not only in climbing but everywhere right now and\u00a0\nuh yeah so that's why i don't want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 uh too much about like dieting and food and\u00a0\neating tips and stuff on this channel because\u00a0\u00a0 i'm not a an expert when it comes to that\u00a0\nand yeah i know how how dangerous it can be\u00a0\u00a0 so so the next tip is to not respect higher grades\u00a0\ni think a lot of people have too much respect they\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"},

climb with straight arms\u00a0\nit's super awkward that's much easier i also think that when your fingers get stronger\u00a0\nit's easier to climb on a straight arm because you\u00a0\u00a0 feel more in control so you can let down uh let\u00a0\nyourself down on a straight arm in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0 it feels very unsecure because you don't know\u00a0\nhow much strength you have in the fingers and\u00a0\u00a0 your natural reaction will be to like\u00a0\nkind of bend your arms a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 even on moves like dinos and stuff\u00a0\nit's often beneficial to keep your\u00a0\u00a0 arms as straight as possible next step waving\u00a0\nyour hands like this you always want dry as\u00a0\u00a0 dry not as dry as possible but you always want\u00a0\ndry skin so especially if it's hot you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 climbers do this so you kind of wave your arms\u00a0\nand you turn or twist the arm halfway so that you\u00a0\u00a0 kind of get as much air as possible you spread\u00a0\nyour fingers out and they will feel a lot drier\u00a0\u00a0 another thing that might keep your fingers dry\u00a0\nis liquid chalk i don't like using liquid chalk\u00a0\u00a0 i think it makes it too dry and i also think\u00a0\nthat it wears out my skin quicker if i use\u00a0\u00a0 liquid shocks so i personally don't like liquid\u00a0\nchalk but that i mean that's for you to decide\u00a0\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to try it at least and\u00a0\nsee if they like it i have found out that i don't\u00a0\u00a0 like it taking care of your skin this is something\u00a0\nthat i could make an entire video on most climbers\u00a0\u00a0 are really obsessed with their skin you'll\u00a0\nsee climbers look down at their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kind of try to figure out how much climbing\u00a0\nis they have left based on how good their skin is\u00a0\u00a0 there's a lot of things you can do sandpapering\u00a0\nthe skin is is very popular also make sure that\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.252, "end": 10.332, "text": "you moisturize the skin a lot of climbers also use\u00a0\nsmall blades to cut off like flakes of skin it's\u00a0\u00a0 all about keeping the skin as even as possible\u00a0\nto make it grow as fast as possible so if it's\u00a0\u00a0 uneven you try to sandpaper down the thick parts\u00a0\nso that everything can grow sometimes i also use\u00a0\u00a0 something called the antihydrol it's a thing\u00a0\nthat i order from germany i don't know how\u00a0\u00a0 healthy that is so i'm not going to recommend\u00a0\nit to any of you guys but there and there's\u00a0\u00a0 also things like rhino skin and i know there's a\u00a0\nlot of other products as well to keep your skin\u00a0\u00a0 dry and dry skin will not wear out as quickly as\u00a0\nuh as wet skin so trying to keep your skin as dry\u00a0\u00a0 as possible while climbing will also make it uh\u00a0\nmore robust so you can climb for longer because i\u00a0\u00a0 feel like often that's what prevents us climbers\u00a0\nfrom climbing as much as we want is our skin\u00a0\u00a0 so trying having good skin care not for your\u00a0\nface but for your fingers is important i should\u00a0\u00a0 also mention that the type of holes that you're\u00a0\nclimbing on really matters when it comes to skin\u00a0\u00a0 like these holes are really rough and then you\u00a0\nhave some other holes that are really nice for the\u00a0\u00a0 skin and if you want to train for a longer time\u00a0\nyou should definitely choose the bowlers with uh\u00a0\u00a0 with with the holes that are not too rough for\u00a0\nthe skin i think it's also important to to know\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need a training program to become\u00a0\nbetter uh even among the top climbers the best\u00a0\u00a0 climbers in the world everyone trains really\u00a0\ndifferently so there's a lot of way to progress\u00a0\u00a0 and i think the best way as i've said before\u00a0\nis just to climb a lot and also to try really\u00a0\u00a0 hard when you when you climb tip number 10 is to\u00a0\nget a hang board you could also get a portable\u00a0\u00a0 hangboard we just released this it's on\u00a0\nrungne.com the link is in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh this you can either use uh separately like\u00a0\nthis you can use it as like sling training and\u00a0\u00a0 you have two different grips this way is a little\u00a0\nbit better this way is a little bit worse this\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously a jug and you can also attach them i\u00a0\nlove the sound it makes when you click it together\u00a0\u00a0 it has four points of attachment so when you put\u00a0\nit up and it's uh and it's not split up then it's\u00a0\u00a0 super super stable this way you also have a jug\u00a0\nhere uh and also this way the edge is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more negative so this is a little bit worse and\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of friction inside here too\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not uh it's not super slippery there's a\u00a0\nlot of techniques that climbers use and i think\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the beginning it's important to try\u00a0\nthem out even if you don't think they will work\u00a0\u00a0 just like drop knees knee bars flagging toe hook\u00a0\nkey hook bicycle pogoing i mean just try out a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of different things because it's always hard\u00a0\nto know what technique to apply to a new problem\u00a0\u00a0 if you haven't climbed it before and i think just\u00a0\nlike instinctively uh realizing what you have\u00a0\u00a0 to do it just comes with practice but the more\u00a0\nyou try different things like techniques in the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning the easier it's gonna get to immediately\u00a0\nknow what technique uh to use on a on a new\u00a0\u00a0 problem it's better to try one hundred percent\u00a0\none time than to try fifty percent two times i\u00a0\u00a0 always go for high quality you have to try really\u00a0\nhard and fail that's the only way that the body\u00a0\u00a0 is gonna improve and become stronger and for high\u00a0\nquality you also you can't be afraid of failing\u00a0\u00a0 in the gym um i know it's uh for me included\u00a0\nit's sometimes you feel like people watching you\u00a0\u00a0 uh you're afraid of making of looking dumb and\u00a0\nfailing in public the gyms are really crowded\u00a0\u00a0 everyone's watching but i think it's important\u00a0\nnot to care too much about failing i mean failing\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely part of any climber's process if\u00a0\nyou don't fail you don't try hard enough for\u00a0\u00a0 most climbers failing is like 90 percent and maybe\u00a0\nnot for Alex Honnold because he's free soloing so\u00a0\u00a0 uh he can't fail but for the rest of us\u00a0\nfailing is definitely a big part of climbing\u00a0\u00a0 okay the next tip is to find a shoe that fits you\u00a0\nreally well and the best way to do that is go to\u00a0\u00a0 like a shoe demo or go to a climbing shop that has\u00a0\nlike a little climbing wall or somewhere where you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out the shoes uh because the shoe will\u00a0\nfeel very different when you put it on and when\u00a0\u00a0 you're actually climbing with it when you put\u00a0\nlike pressure on the different parts of the shoe\u00a0\u00a0 so make sure that you can actually try out\u00a0\nthe shoes before deciding on a shoe and we\u00a0\u00a0 all have like our feet are very different so it's\u00a0\nimportant that you find a shoe that fits your foot\u00a0\u00a0 so if i tell you that a shoe is really good for me\u00a0\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's good for you\u00a0\u00a0 but there are definitely some good and some bad\u00a0\nshoes out there okay the next uh tip is also a\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 10.332, "end": 15.4147, "text": "climbing skin related tip it's to wash off the\u00a0\nchalk after climbing immediately because the skin\u00a0\u00a0 will not start growing until you get the chalk off\u00a0\nso make sure that you wash your hands immediately\u00a0\u00a0 after climbing so that the healing process of the\u00a0\nskin can start as quickly as possible okay so the\u00a0\u00a0 next tip is to make bowlers once in a while on\u00a0\na wall like the one behind me a case wall also\u00a0\u00a0 called a spray wall it's just full of holes and\u00a0\nyou decide what holes to use for your hands and\u00a0\u00a0 for your feet i think it's very good for memory\u00a0\nbut also to understand how to move on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 and how root setters think you know it's it's\u00a0\nnot only the size of the holes and the distance\u00a0\u00a0 between holes that make a roller hard it's more\u00a0\ncomplex than that and i think making bowlers on\u00a0\u00a0 a wall like this will give you a much better\u00a0\nunderstanding of not only how the roots are\u00a0\u00a0 think but also just how the body works and how\u00a0\nlike different moves work so definitely encourage\u00a0\u00a0 everyone to to do this once in a while it's\u00a0\nprobably not as fun as like regular baldering just\u00a0\u00a0 walking around having a lot of preset bowlers it's\u00a0\nkind of a everything back in the days everything\u00a0\u00a0 used to be like this ever like you you had to\u00a0\nmake your own problems with friends uh you had\u00a0\u00a0 to remember those problems for the next session\u00a0\nbut nowadays uh everything is just preset in\u00a0\u00a0 colors on big walls that they change out\u00a0\noften my next step is to train more core\u00a0\u00a0 i think a lot of us we kind of stop training when\u00a0\nour skin and fingers and arms feel worked it feels\u00a0\u00a0 like you can't climb anymore but i think training\u00a0\na little bit more core after that because core is\u00a0\u00a0 just completely different you can train a lot more\u00a0\ncore even when your fingers and arms are finished\u00a0\u00a0 so training more core at the end of the session\u00a0\ni think would benefit any climber uh the next tip\u00a0\u00a0 probably comes as a surprise to most of you but\u00a0\nit's to warm up i i joke about this but i feel bad\u00a0\u00a0 for joking about it it's also very personal\u00a0\nhow much warming up your body needs but i think\u00a0\u00a0 you should definitely warm up for 20 minutes to\u00a0\nhalf an hour to to just prevent injuries and to\u00a0\u00a0 also get your body ready to just pull really hard\u00a0\ni've always been really bad at warming up and it's\u00a0\u00a0 definitely something that i should become better\u00a0\nat now that i'm getting older definitely warm up\u00a0\u00a0 find a routine that works for you there's a lot of\u00a0\ntutorials on this on on youtube but again i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's important to find a warm-up routine that\u00a0\nworks for you it's i think in general training and\u00a0\u00a0 also dieting and everything it's it's a lot more\u00a0\npersonal than we think so um you should always\u00a0\u00a0 try to find a thing experiment a little bit and\u00a0\ntry to find things that work for you not listen\u00a0\u00a0 blindly to what other people have to say um\u00a0\nthe next thing is dieting it's something that\u00a0\u00a0 i haven't talked so much about on this channel\u00a0\nbut of course weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 unfortunately i would say because i don't know\u00a0\nit's something that a lot of climbers struggle\u00a0\u00a0 with and i feel like sometimes losing weight\u00a0\nuh is like a short-term solution it's uh it's\u00a0\u00a0 like a shortcut i don't know i would not encourage\u00a0\nanyone to to really go on a diet if it's not for\u00a0\u00a0 for health reasons right now i'm trying to\u00a0\nactually gain a little bit of weight because\u00a0\u00a0 i i was a little bit lighter and i don't\u00a0\nknow i feel like my mood and everything my\u00a0\u00a0 like the quality of life goes down and for me\u00a0\nit's not worth it now that i'm not a professional\u00a0\u00a0 anymore it's definitely if you have a weight\u00a0\nto lose and you feel like you can do it in a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy way then then it's it could be a good\u00a0\nthing because weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 but at the same time i would also uh warn\u00a0\nyou against like dieting too hard and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a rabbit hole that a lot of people\u00a0\na lot of climbers uh fall into and never get out\u00a0\u00a0 of so like a lot of climbers have problems with\u00a0\neating disorders i've had it as well uh in my\u00a0\u00a0 in my youth and uh i would also encourage\u00a0\npeople to to look around and try to try to see\u00a0\u00a0 uh try to help other people with eating disorders\u00a0\nbecause it's a serious problem in climbing and\u00a0\u00a0 not only in climbing but everywhere right now and\u00a0\nuh yeah so that's why i don't want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 uh too much about like dieting and food and\u00a0\neating tips and stuff on this channel because\u00a0\u00a0 i'm not a an expert when it comes to that\u00a0\nand yeah i know how how dangerous it can be\u00a0\u00a0 so so the next tip is to not respect higher grades\u00a0\ni think a

Warefuly matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream. Refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on, Monsters, Inc is there. We're working for a better tomorrow, today ! We're Monsters, Incorporated, we scare because we care. \u2026 producing electricity with children's screams \u2026 ... ok why not. (On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field. It may sound a bit highbrow but piezoelectrics are very common and we can find them in a variety of daily-life objects. For example:", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.1567, "end": 10.1763, "text": "An individual finds himself facing a satanic symbol.\n(This is the logo of a really shitty but succesful tv show in France) Then, he grabs his piezo lighter in his pocket. By pushing the button, he compresses the piezo crystal hidden inside, creating a electrical surcharge dissipated as a small spark, lighting up the flame. Armed qith the malicious power of fire, the man can burn the evil on this land and make the world a better place. Same thing for a gas cooker ! I like the piezoelectric theory for several reasons. Firstly, beyond lighters, it's already used for sound systems such as mics and speakers, but very very thin. It seems relevant for our problem: we just have to cover the door with some piezo overlay and we would have our energy converter. The other advantage is that, the energy collection is integrated in the door, it could power itself ! Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation. I'm sorry this conclusion is a bit funk depression. Wait no I meant full depression ... What am I saying ? funk depression? ... funk dep... funk depression! We screwed the planet!

Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy.

Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly.

Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation.

That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves.

To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave.

A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising.

(On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation.

For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation. I'm sorry this conclusion is a bit funk depression. Wait no I meant full depression ... What am I saying ? funk depression? ... funk dep... funk depression! We screwed the planet! Far right politicians going strong all over the world ... Future nice vibes at the frontier! I love water, in 20 years it will be gone.

Well, I'm not really teaching you anything, this is not news. The skyrocketing development of humankind comes largely thanks to its capacity to produce, to stock and to use energy in order to accomplish things impossible for the body alone. And nowadays, when one speak about \"access to energy\", one talks about this gesture. One simple gesture which grants everyone electricity, powering the majority of the devices around us including the ones used to make this video or to allow you to look at it while you're on the toilet. Yes but where does electricty comes from ? Because we didn't answer anythi... Well ! We can indeed ask ourself this question given the fact that \"natural\" electricity is \nextremely rare and instable just like lightning for example. What am I doing here ? (This is the old set of an famous french tv show about science) Ha ! That's better (This is the classic set of the channel, black bg) ! So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising. One need to consume more, to grow faster and it's not without additional energy\nbut also additional pollution Meanwhile, temperatures and oceans are rising\nbiodiversity is shrinking and even if we're still looking a infinite, non-polluting form of energy we're realizing that it won't exist and that we are in big train which is speeding up into the wall of extinction. \u201cIt is my professional opinion that now is the time to PANIC.\u201d This is Boo. Boo is a child and like Nutella once said in a french ad Children needs energy. In other words, a child contains energy. Thus one might consider exploiting children as a energy source. And of course, those people are monsters ... I mean litteraly. The future is bright at Monsters, Inc! We power your car, we warm your home, we light your city! Warefuly matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream. Refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on, Monsters, Inc is there. We're working for a better tomorrow, today ! We're Monsters, Incorporated, we scare because we care. \u2026 producing electricity with children's screams \u2026 ... ok why not. (On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field. It may sound a bit highbrow but piezoelectrics are very common and we can find them in a variety of daily-life objects. For example:", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.1567, "end": 10.1763, "text": "An individual finds himself facing a satanic symbol.\n(This is the logo of a really shitty but succesful tv show in France) Then, he grabs his piezo lighter in his pocket. By pushing the button, he compresses the piezo crystal hidden inside, creating a electrical surcharge dissipated as a small spark, lighting up the flame. Armed qith the malicious power of fire, the man can burn the evil on this land and make the world a better place. Same thing for a gas cooker ! I like the piezoelectric theory for several reasons. Firstly, beyond lighters, it's already used for sound systems such as mics and speakers, but very very thin. It seems relevant for our problem: we just have to cover the door with some piezo overlay and we would have our energy converter. The other advantage is that, the energy collection is integrated in the door, it could power itself ! Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry.

that you didn't know that\u00a0\nany climbers should know i guess so it's going\u00a0\u00a0 to be i'm going to go through them really quickly\u00a0\nif you guys have any like if you want me to go in\u00a0\u00a0 depth on some of them please comment below maybe\u00a0\ni can make a like a specific video on a specific\u00a0\u00a0 uh subject it's 20 tips and tricks so that's\u00a0\nkind of a lot um so i'm just going to jump in\u00a0\u00a0 the first tip is back in the days 20 years\u00a0\nago when i started climbing this was only\u00a0\u00a0 for the professionals i remember\u00a0\nall the professionals used a camera\u00a0\u00a0 a film camera not like this this is an iphone but\u00a0\nuh like a big chunky camera to study the technique\u00a0\u00a0 nowadays we all have a cell phone and i\u00a0\nthink filming yourself is not only good for\u00a0\u00a0 posting on instagram or on youtube\u00a0\nbut also to analyze your technique\u00a0\u00a0 trying to figure out what you can do better and i\u00a0\nthink a lot of you if you haven't filmed yourself\u00a0\u00a0 climbing it's often like completely different from\u00a0\nhow you you think you're climbing uh the next step\u00a0\u00a0 is to clean your shoes from chalk there's a\u00a0\nlot of chalk in the gym when we walk around\u00a0\u00a0 if you look underneath the sole of your shoe after\u00a0\na while it's probably going to be completely white\u00a0\u00a0 chalk makes our skin really sticky but not the\u00a0\nrubber on our shoes so make sure that you clean\u00a0\u00a0 your shoes i would say the only exception is\u00a0\nwhen uh your shoe is wet then sometimes it\u00a0\u00a0 could be good to to dry it up with a little bit of\u00a0\nchalk but otherwise try to keep your your shoes as\u00a0\u00a0 chalk free as possible don't over grip or re-grip\u00a0\ntoo much you see a lot of especially beginners\u00a0\u00a0 when after they grab a hole they adjust it they\u00a0\nkind of jank it to to get it a little bit better\u00a0\u00a0 but i think in most cases it's better to just\u00a0\ngrab it maybe adjust it one time and then move on\u00a0\u00a0 climbing faster i consider myself a pretty fast\u00a0\nclimber but i feel like me included i can also\u00a0\u00a0 climb a lot faster i try to tell myself to climb\u00a0\nfaster when i look at people like Adam Ondra and sometimes when you climb fast it's hard to\u00a0\nto climb everything technically perfect but if\u00a0\u00a0 you put up like a side by side comparison you try\u00a0\nto climb a bowler perfectly and you're trying to\u00a0\u00a0 just climb it as fast as possible i think often\u00a0\nclimbing it just as fast as possible will feel\u00a0\u00a0 easier because you spend less time on the wall but\u00a0\nthe the best thing is obviously if you can do both\u00a0\u00a0 like you climb it perfectly and you climb it fast\u00a0\nlike perfect technique and fast but that's really\u00a0\u00a0 hard to do so if i had to choose between the two\u00a0\ni would just climb uh fast when i started climbing\u00a0\u00a0 everything was about climbing as nicely\u00a0\nas possible doing a lot of drop knees\u00a0\u00a0 and trying to stay as close to the wall\u00a0\ndoing everything really controlled but\u00a0\u00a0 i feel like the new school technique is to just\u00a0\nrely more on power and try to climb things quicker next tip is something that you probably\u00a0\nheard from your climbing coach or whatever\u00a0\u00a0 a million times climb with straight arms\u00a0\nit's super awkward that's much easier i also think that when your fingers get stronger\u00a0\nit's easier to climb on a straight arm because you\u00a0\u00a0 feel more in control so you can let down uh let\u00a0\nyourself down on a straight arm in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0 it feels very unsecure because you don't know\u00a0\nhow much strength you have in the fingers and\u00a0\u00a0 your natural reaction will be to like\u00a0\nkind of bend your arms a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 even on moves like dinos and stuff\u00a0\nit's often beneficial to keep your\u00a0\u00a0 arms as straight as possible next step waving\u00a0\nyour hands like this you always want dry as\u00a0\u00a0 dry not as dry as possible but you always want\u00a0\ndry skin so especially if it's hot you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 climbers do this so you kind of wave your arms\u00a0\nand you turn or twist the arm halfway so that you\u00a0\u00a0 kind of get as much air as possible you spread\u00a0\nyour fingers out and they will feel a lot drier\u00a0\u00a0 another thing that might keep your fingers dry\u00a0\nis liquid chalk i don't like using liquid chalk\u00a0\u00a0 i think it makes it too dry and i also think\u00a0\nthat it wears out my skin quicker if i use\u00a0\u00a0 liquid shocks so i personally don't like liquid\u00a0\nchalk but that i mean that's for you to decide\u00a0\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to try it at least and\u00a0\nsee if they like it i have found out that i don't\u00a0\u00a0 like it taking care of your skin this is something\u00a0\nthat i could make an entire video on most climbers\u00a0\u00a0 are really obsessed with their skin you'll\u00a0\nsee climbers look down at their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kind of try to figure out how much climbing\u00a0\nis they have left based on how good their skin is\u00a0\u00a0 there's a lot of things you can do sandpapering\u00a0\nthe skin is is very popular also make sure that\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.252, "end": 10.332, "text": "you moisturize the skin a lot of climbers also use\u00a0\nsmall blades to cut off like flakes of skin it's\u00a0\u00a0 all about keeping the skin as even as possible\u00a0\nto make it grow as fast as possible so if it's\u00a0\u00a0 uneven you try to sandpaper down the thick parts\u00a0\nso that everything can grow sometimes i also use\u00a0\u00a0 something called the antihydrol it's a thing\u00a0\nthat i order from germany i don't know how\u00a0\u00a0 healthy that is so i'm not going to recommend\u00a0\nit to any of you guys but there and there's\u00a0\u00a0 also things like rhino skin and i know there's a\u00a0\nlot of other products as well to keep your skin\u00a0\u00a0 dry and dry skin will not wear out as quickly as\u00a0\nuh as wet skin so trying to keep your skin as dry\u00a0\u00a0 as possible while climbing will also make it uh\u00a0\nmore robust so you can climb for longer because i\u00a0\u00a0 feel like often that's what prevents us climbers\u00a0\nfrom climbing as much as we want is our skin\u00a0\u00a0 so trying having good skin care not for your\u00a0\nface but for your fingers is important i should\u00a0\u00a0 also mention that the type of holes that you're\u00a0\nclimbing on really matters when it comes to skin\u00a0\u00a0 like these holes are really rough and then you\u00a0\nhave some other holes that are really nice for the\u00a0\u00a0 skin and if you want to train for a longer time\u00a0\nyou should definitely choose the bowlers with uh\u00a0\u00a0 with with the holes that are not too rough for\u00a0\nthe skin i think it's also important to to know\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need a training program to become\u00a0\nbetter uh even among the top climbers the best\u00a0\u00a0 climbers in the world everyone trains really\u00a0\ndifferently so there's a lot of way to progress\u00a0\u00a0 and i think the best way as i've said before\u00a0\nis just to climb a lot and also to try really\u00a0\u00a0 hard when you when you climb tip number 10 is to\u00a0\nget a hang board you could also get a portable\u00a0\u00a0 hangboard we just released this it's on\u00a0\nrungne.com the link is in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh this you can either use uh separately like\u00a0\nthis you can use it as like sling training and\u00a0\u00a0 you have two different grips this way is a little\u00a0\nbit better this way is a little bit worse this\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously a jug and you can also attach them i\u00a0\nlove the sound it makes when you click it together\u00a0\u00a0 it has four points of attachment so when you put\u00a0\nit up and it's uh and it's not split up then it's\u00a0\u00a0 super super stable this way you also have a jug\u00a0\nhere uh and also this way the edge is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more negative so this is a little bit worse and\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of friction inside here too\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not uh it's not super slippery there's a\u00a0\nlot of techniques that climbers use and i think\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the beginning it's important to try\u00a0\nthem out even if you don't think they will work\u00a0\u00a0 just like drop knees knee bars flagging toe hook\u00a0\nkey hook bicycle pogoing i mean just try out a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of different things because it's always hard\u00a0\nto know what technique to apply to a new problem\u00a0\u00a0 if you haven't climbed it before and i think just\u00a0\nlike instinctively uh realizing what you have\u00a0\u00a0 to do it just comes with practice but the more\u00a0\nyou try different things like techniques in the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning the easier it's gonna get to immediately\u00a0\nknow what technique uh to use on a on a new\u00a0\u00a0 problem it's better to try one hundred percent\u00a0\none time than to try fifty percent two times i\u00a0\u00a0 always go for high quality you have to try really\u00a0\nhard and fail that's the only way that the body\u00a0\u00a0 is gonna improve and become stronger and for high\u00a0\nquality you also you can't be afraid of failing\u00a0\u00a0 in the gym um i know it's uh for me included\u00a0\nit's sometimes you feel like people watching you\u00a0\u00a0 uh you're afraid of making of looking dumb and\u00a0\nfailing in public the gyms are really crowded\u00a0\u00a0 everyone's watching but i think it's important\u00a0\nnot to care too much about failing i mean failing\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely part of any climber's process if\u00a0\nyou don't fail you don't try hard enough for\u00a0\u00a0 most climbers failing is like 90 percent and maybe\u00a0\nnot for Alex Honnold because he's free soloing so\u00a0\u00a0 uh he can't fail but for the rest of us\u00a0\nfailing is definitely a big part of climbing\u00a0\u00a0 okay the next tip is to find a shoe that fits you\u00a0\nreally well and the best way to do that is go to\u00a0\u00a0 like a shoe demo or go to a climbing shop that has\u00a0\nlike a little climbing wall or somewhere where you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out the shoes uh because the shoe will\u00a0\nfeel very different when you put it on and when\u00a0\u00a0 you're actually climbing with it when you put\u00a0\nlike pressure on the different parts of the shoe\u00a0\u00a0 so make sure that you can actually try out\u00a0\nthe shoes before deciding on a shoe and we\u00a0\u00a0 all have like our feet are very different so it's\u00a0\nimportant that you find a shoe that fits your foot\u00a0\u00a0 so if i tell you that a shoe is really good for me\u00a0\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's good for you\u00a0\u00a0 but there are definitely some good and some bad\u00a0\nshoes out there okay the next uh tip is also a\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 10.332, "end": 15.4147, "text": "climbing skin related tip it's to wash off the\u00a0\nchalk after climbing immediately because the skin\u00a0\u00a0 will not start growing until you get the chalk off\u00a0\nso make sure that you wash your hands immediately\u00a0\u00a0 after climbing so that the healing process of the\u00a0\nskin can start as quickly as possible okay so the\u00a0\u00a0 next tip is to make bowlers once in a while on\u00a0\na wall like the one behind me a case wall also\u00a0\u00a0 called a spray wall it's just full of holes and\u00a0\nyou decide what holes to use for your hands and\u00a0\u00a0 for your feet i think it's very good for memory\u00a0\nbut also to understand how to move on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 and how root setters think you know it's it's\u00a0\nnot only the size of the holes and the distance\u00a0\u00a0 between holes that make a roller hard it's more\u00a0\ncomplex than that and i think making bowlers on\u00a0\u00a0 a wall like this will give you a much better\u00a0\nunderstanding of not only how the roots are\u00a0\u00a0 think but also just how the body works and how\u00a0\nlike different moves work so definitely encourage\u00a0\u00a0 everyone to to do this once in a while it's\u00a0\nprobably not as fun as like regular baldering just\u00a0\u00a0 walking around having a lot of preset bowlers it's\u00a0\nkind of a everything back in the days everything\u00a0\u00a0 used to be like this ever like you you had to\u00a0\nmake your own problems with friends uh you had\u00a0\u00a0 to remember those problems for the next session\u00a0\nbut nowadays uh everything is just preset in\u00a0\u00a0 colors on big walls that they change out\u00a0\noften my next step is to train more core\u00a0\u00a0 i think a lot of us we kind of stop training when\u00a0\nour skin and fingers and arms feel worked it feels\u00a0\u00a0 like you can't climb anymore but i think training\u00a0\na little bit more core after that because core is\u00a0\u00a0 just completely different you can train a lot more\u00a0\ncore even when your fingers and arms are finished\u00a0\u00a0 so training more core at the end of the session\u00a0\ni think would benefit any climber uh the next tip\u00a0\u00a0 probably comes as a surprise to most of you but\u00a0\nit's to warm up i i joke about this but i feel bad\u00a0\u00a0 for joking about it it's also very personal\u00a0\nhow much warming up your body needs but i think\u00a0\u00a0 you should definitely warm up for 20 minutes to\u00a0\nhalf an hour to to just prevent injuries and to\u00a0\u00a0 also get your body ready to just pull really hard\u00a0\ni've always been really bad at warming up and it's\u00a0\u00a0 definitely something that i should become better\u00a0\nat now that i'm getting older definitely warm up\u00a0\u00a0 find a routine that works for you there's a lot of\u00a0\ntutorials on this on on youtube but again i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's important to find a warm-up routine that\u00a0\nworks for you it's i think in general training and\u00a0\u00a0 also dieting and everything it's it's a lot more\u00a0\npersonal than we think so um you should always\u00a0\u00a0 try to find a thing experiment a little bit and\u00a0\ntry to find things that work for you not listen\u00a0\u00a0 blindly to what other people have to say um\u00a0\nthe next thing is dieting it's something that\u00a0\u00a0 i haven't talked so much about on this channel\u00a0\nbut of course weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 unfortunately i would say because i don't know\u00a0\nit's something that a lot of climbers struggle\u00a0\u00a0 with and i feel like sometimes losing weight\u00a0\nuh is like a short-term solution it's uh it's\u00a0\u00a0 like a shortcut i don't know i would not encourage\u00a0\nanyone to to really go on a diet if it's not for\u00a0\u00a0 for health reasons right now i'm trying to\u00a0\nactually gain a little bit of weight because\u00a0\u00a0 i i was a little bit lighter and i don't\u00a0\nknow i feel like my mood and everything my\u00a0\u00a0 like the quality of life goes down and for me\u00a0\nit's not worth it now that i'm not a professional\u00a0\u00a0 anymore it's definitely if you have a weight\u00a0\nto lose and you feel like you can do it in a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy way then then it's it could be a good\u00a0\nthing because weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 but at the same time i would also uh warn\u00a0\nyou against like dieting too hard and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a rabbit hole that a lot of people\u00a0\na lot of climbers uh fall into and never get out\u00a0\u00a0 of so like a lot of climbers have problems with\u00a0\neating disorders i've had it as well uh in my\u00a0\u00a0 in my youth and uh i would also encourage\u00a0\npeople to to look around and try to try to see\u00a0\u00a0 uh try to help other people with eating disorders\u00a0\nbecause it's a serious problem in climbing and\u00a0\u00a0 not only in climbing but everywhere right now and\u00a0\nuh yeah so that's why i don't want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 uh too much about like dieting and food and\u00a0\neating tips and stuff on this channel because\u00a0\u00a0 i'm not a an expert when it comes to that\u00a0\nand yeah i know how how dangerous it can be\u00a0\u00a0 so so the next tip is to not respect higher grades\u00a0\ni think a lot of people have too much respect they\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"},

make a like a specific video on a specific\u00a0\u00a0 uh subject it's 20 tips and tricks so that's\u00a0\nkind of a lot um so i'm just going to jump in\u00a0\u00a0 the first tip is back in the days 20 years\u00a0\nago when i started climbing this was only\u00a0\u00a0 for the professionals i remember\u00a0\nall the professionals used a camera\u00a0\u00a0 a film camera not like this this is an iphone but\u00a0\nuh like a big chunky camera to study the technique\u00a0\u00a0 nowadays we all have a cell phone and i\u00a0\nthink filming yourself is not only good for\u00a0\u00a0 posting on instagram or on youtube\u00a0\nbut also to analyze your technique\u00a0\u00a0 trying to figure out what you can do better and i\u00a0\nthink a lot of you if you haven't filmed yourself\u00a0\u00a0 climbing it's often like completely different from\u00a0\nhow you you think you're climbing uh the next step\u00a0\u00a0 is to clean your shoes from chalk there's a\u00a0\nlot of chalk in the gym when we walk around\u00a0\u00a0 if you look underneath the sole of your shoe after\u00a0\na while it's probably going to be completely white\u00a0\u00a0 chalk makes our skin really sticky but not the\u00a0\nrubber on our shoes so make sure that you clean\u00a0\u00a0 your shoes i would say the only exception is\u00a0\nwhen uh your shoe is wet then sometimes it\u00a0\u00a0 could be good to to dry it up with a little bit of\u00a0\nchalk but otherwise try to keep your your shoes as\u00a0\u00a0 chalk free as possible don't over grip or re-grip\u00a0\ntoo much you see a lot of especially beginners\u00a0\u00a0 when after they grab a hole they adjust it they\u00a0\nkind of jank it to to get it a little bit better\u00a0\u00a0 but i think in most cases it's better to just\u00a0\ngrab it maybe adjust it one time and then move on\u00a0\u00a0 climbing faster i consider myself a pretty fast\u00a0\nclimber but i feel like me included i can also\u00a0\u00a0 climb a lot faster i try to tell myself to climb\u00a0\nfaster when i look at people like Adam Ondra and sometimes when you climb fast it's hard to\u00a0\nto climb everything technically perfect but if\u00a0\u00a0 you put up like a side by side comparison you try\u00a0\nto climb a bowler perfectly and you're trying to\u00a0\u00a0 just climb it as fast as possible i think often\u00a0\nclimbing it just as fast as possible will feel\u00a0\u00a0 easier because you spend less time on the wall but\u00a0\nthe the best thing is obviously if you can do both\u00a0\u00a0 like you climb it perfectly and you climb it fast\u00a0\nlike perfect technique and fast but that's really\u00a0\u00a0 hard to do so if i had to choose between the two\u00a0\ni would just climb uh fast when i started climbing\u00a0\u00a0 everything was about climbing as nicely\u00a0\nas possible doing a lot of drop knees\u00a0\u00a0 and trying to stay as close to the wall\u00a0\ndoing everything really controlled but\u00a0\u00a0 i feel like the new school technique is to just\u00a0\nrely more on power and try to climb things quicker next tip is something that you probably\u00a0\nheard from your climbing coach or whatever\u00a0\u00a0 a million times climb with straight arms\u00a0\nit's super awkward that's much easier i also think that when your fingers get stronger\u00a0\nit's easier to climb on a straight arm because you\u00a0\u00a0 feel more in control so you can let down uh let\u00a0\nyourself down on a straight arm in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0 it feels very unsecure because you don't know\u00a0\nhow much strength you have in the fingers and\u00a0\u00a0 your natural reaction will be to like\u00a0\nkind of bend your arms a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 even on moves like dinos and stuff\u00a0\nit's often beneficial to keep your\u00a0\u00a0 arms as straight as possible next step waving\u00a0\nyour hands like this you always want dry as\u00a0\u00a0 dry not as dry as possible but you always want\u00a0\ndry skin so especially if it's hot you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 climbers do this so you kind of wave your arms\u00a0\nand you turn or twist the arm halfway so that you\u00a0\u00a0 kind of get as much air as possible you spread\u00a0\nyour fingers out and they will feel a lot drier\u00a0\u00a0 another thing that might keep your fingers dry\u00a0\nis liquid chalk i don't like using liquid chalk\u00a0\u00a0 i think it makes it too dry and i also think\u00a0\nthat it wears out my skin quicker if i use\u00a0\u00a0 liquid shocks so i personally don't like liquid\u00a0\nchalk but that i mean that's for you to decide\u00a0\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to try it at least and\u00a0\nsee if they like it i have found out that i don't\u00a0\u00a0 like it taking care of your skin this is something\u00a0\nthat i could make an entire video on most climbers\u00a0\u00a0 are really obsessed with their skin you'll\u00a0\nsee climbers look down at their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kind of try to figure out how much climbing\u00a0\nis they have left based on how good their skin is\u00a0\u00a0 there's a lot of things you can do sandpapering\u00a0\nthe skin is is very popular also make sure that\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 5.252, "end": 10.332, "text": "you moisturize the skin a lot of climbers also use\u00a0\nsmall blades to cut off like flakes of skin it's\u00a0\u00a0 all about keeping the skin as even as possible\u00a0\nto make it grow as fast as possible so if it's\u00a0\u00a0 uneven you try to sandpaper down the thick parts\u00a0\nso that everything can grow sometimes i also use\u00a0\u00a0 something called the antihydrol it's a thing\u00a0\nthat i order from germany i don't know how\u00a0\u00a0 healthy that is so i'm not going to recommend\u00a0\nit to any of you guys but there and there's\u00a0\u00a0 also things like rhino skin and i know there's a\u00a0\nlot of other products as well to keep your skin\u00a0\u00a0 dry and dry skin will not wear out as quickly as\u00a0\nuh as wet skin so trying to keep your skin as dry\u00a0\u00a0 as possible while climbing will also make it uh\u00a0\nmore robust so you can climb for longer because i\u00a0\u00a0 feel like often that's what prevents us climbers\u00a0\nfrom climbing as much as we want is our skin\u00a0\u00a0 so trying having good skin care not for your\u00a0\nface but for your fingers is important i should\u00a0\u00a0 also mention that the type of holes that you're\u00a0\nclimbing on really matters when it comes to skin\u00a0\u00a0 like these holes are really rough and then you\u00a0\nhave some other holes that are really nice for the\u00a0\u00a0 skin and if you want to train for a longer time\u00a0\nyou should definitely choose the bowlers with uh\u00a0\u00a0 with with the holes that are not too rough for\u00a0\nthe skin i think it's also important to to know\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need a training program to become\u00a0\nbetter uh even among the top climbers the best\u00a0\u00a0 climbers in the world everyone trains really\u00a0\ndifferently so there's a lot of way to progress\u00a0\u00a0 and i think the best way as i've said before\u00a0\nis just to climb a lot and also to try really\u00a0\u00a0 hard when you when you climb tip number 10 is to\u00a0\nget a hang board you could also get a portable\u00a0\u00a0 hangboard we just released this it's on\u00a0\nrungne.com the link is in the description\u00a0\u00a0 uh this you can either use uh separately like\u00a0\nthis you can use it as like sling training and\u00a0\u00a0 you have two different grips this way is a little\u00a0\nbit better this way is a little bit worse this\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously a jug and you can also attach them i\u00a0\nlove the sound it makes when you click it together\u00a0\u00a0 it has four points of attachment so when you put\u00a0\nit up and it's uh and it's not split up then it's\u00a0\u00a0 super super stable this way you also have a jug\u00a0\nhere uh and also this way the edge is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more negative so this is a little bit worse and\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of friction inside here too\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not uh it's not super slippery there's a\u00a0\nlot of techniques that climbers use and i think\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the beginning it's important to try\u00a0\nthem out even if you don't think they will work\u00a0\u00a0 just like drop knees knee bars flagging toe hook\u00a0\nkey hook bicycle pogoing i mean just try out a\u00a0\u00a0 bunch of different things because it's always hard\u00a0\nto know what technique to apply to a new problem\u00a0\u00a0 if you haven't climbed it before and i think just\u00a0\nlike instinctively uh realizing what you have\u00a0\u00a0 to do it just comes with practice but the more\u00a0\nyou try different things like techniques in the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning the easier it's gonna get to immediately\u00a0\nknow what technique uh to use on a on a new\u00a0\u00a0 problem it's better to try one hundred percent\u00a0\none time than to try fifty percent two times i\u00a0\u00a0 always go for high quality you have to try really\u00a0\nhard and fail that's the only way that the body\u00a0\u00a0 is gonna improve and become stronger and for high\u00a0\nquality you also you can't be afraid of failing\u00a0\u00a0 in the gym um i know it's uh for me included\u00a0\nit's sometimes you feel like people watching you\u00a0\u00a0 uh you're afraid of making of looking dumb and\u00a0\nfailing in public the gyms are really crowded\u00a0\u00a0 everyone's watching but i think it's important\u00a0\nnot to care too much about failing i mean failing\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely part of any climber's process if\u00a0\nyou don't fail you don't try hard enough for\u00a0\u00a0 most climbers failing is like 90 percent and maybe\u00a0\nnot for Alex Honnold because he's free soloing so\u00a0\u00a0 uh he can't fail but for the rest of us\u00a0\nfailing is definitely a big part of climbing\u00a0\u00a0 okay the next tip is to find a shoe that fits you\u00a0\nreally well and the best way to do that is go to\u00a0\u00a0 like a shoe demo or go to a climbing shop that has\u00a0\nlike a little climbing wall or somewhere where you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out the shoes uh because the shoe will\u00a0\nfeel very different when you put it on and when\u00a0\u00a0 you're actually climbing with it when you put\u00a0\nlike pressure on the different parts of the shoe\u00a0\u00a0 so make sure that you can actually try out\u00a0\nthe shoes before deciding on a shoe and we\u00a0\u00a0 all have like our feet are very different so it's\u00a0\nimportant that you find a shoe that fits your foot\u00a0\u00a0 so if i tell you that a shoe is really good for me\u00a0\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's good for you\u00a0\u00a0 but there are definitely some good and some bad\u00a0\nshoes out there okay the next uh tip is also a\u00a0\u00a0", "summary": "summary"}, {"start": 10.332, "end": 15.4147, "text": "climbing skin related tip it's to wash off the\u00a0\nchalk after climbing immediately because the skin\u00a0\u00a0 will not start growing until you get the chalk off\u00a0\nso make sure that you wash your hands immediately\u00a0\u00a0 after climbing so that the healing process of the\u00a0\nskin can start as quickly as possible okay so the\u00a0\u00a0 next tip is to make bowlers once in a while on\u00a0\na wall like the one behind me a case wall also\u00a0\u00a0 called a spray wall it's just full of holes and\u00a0\nyou decide what holes to use for your hands and\u00a0\u00a0 for your feet i think it's very good for memory\u00a0\nbut also to understand how to move on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 and how root setters think you know it's it's\u00a0\nnot only the size of the holes and the distance\u00a0\u00a0 between holes that make a roller hard it's more\u00a0\ncomplex than that and i think making bowlers on\u00a0\u00a0 a wall like this will give you a much better\u00a0\nunderstanding of not only how the roots are\u00a0\u00a0 think but also just how the body works and how\u00a0\nlike different moves work so definitely encourage\u00a0\u00a0 everyone to to do this once in a while it's\u00a0\nprobably not as fun as like regular baldering just\u00a0\u00a0 walking around having a lot of preset bowlers it's\u00a0\nkind of a everything back in the days everything\u00a0\u00a0 used to be like this ever like you you had to\u00a0\nmake your own problems with friends uh you had\u00a0\u00a0 to remember those problems for the next session\u00a0\nbut nowadays uh everything is just preset in\u00a0\u00a0 colors on big walls that they change out\u00a0\noften my next step is to train more core\u00a0\u00a0 i think a lot of us we kind of stop training when\u00a0\nour skin and fingers and arms feel worked it feels\u00a0\u00a0 like you can't climb anymore but i think training\u00a0\na little bit more core after that because core is\u00a0\u00a0 just completely different you can train a lot more\u00a0\ncore even when your fingers and arms are finished\u00a0\u00a0 so training more core at the end of the session\u00a0\ni think would benefit any climber uh the next tip\u00a0\u00a0 probably comes as a surprise to most of you but\u00a0\nit's to warm up i i joke about this but i feel bad\u00a0\u00a0 for joking about it it's also very personal\u00a0\nhow much warming up your body needs but i think\u00a0\u00a0 you should definitely warm up for 20 minutes to\u00a0\nhalf an hour to to just prevent injuries and to\u00a0\u00a0 also get your body ready to just pull really hard\u00a0\ni've always been really bad at warming up and it's\u00a0\u00a0 definitely something that i should become better\u00a0\nat now that i'm getting older definitely warm up\u00a0\u00a0 find a routine that works for you there's a lot of\u00a0\ntutorials on this on on youtube but again i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's important to find a warm-up routine that\u00a0\nworks for you it's i think in general training and\u00a0\u00a0 also dieting and everything it's it's a lot more\u00a0\npersonal than we think so um you should always\u00a0\u00a0 try to find a thing experiment a little bit and\u00a0\ntry to find things that work for you not listen\u00a0\u00a0 blindly to what other people have to say um\u00a0\nthe next thing is dieting it's something that\u00a0\u00a0 i haven't talked so much about on this channel\u00a0\nbut of course weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 unfortunately i would say because i don't know\u00a0\nit's something that a lot of climbers struggle\u00a0\u00a0 with and i feel like sometimes losing weight\u00a0\nuh is like a short-term solution it's uh it's\u00a0\u00a0 like a shortcut i don't know i would not encourage\u00a0\nanyone to to really go on a diet if it's not for\u00a0\u00a0 for health reasons right now i'm trying to\u00a0\nactually gain a little bit of weight because\u00a0\u00a0 i i was a little bit lighter and i don't\u00a0\nknow i feel like my mood and everything my\u00a0\u00a0 like the quality of life goes down and for me\u00a0\nit's not worth it now that i'm not a

weight is important in climbing\u00a0\u00a0 but at the same time i would also uh warn\u00a0\nyou against like dieting too hard and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it's a rabbit hole that a lot of people\u00a0\na lot of climbers uh fall into and never get out\u00a0\u00a0 of so like a lot of climbers have problems with\u00a0\neating disorders i've had it as well uh in my\u00a0\u00a0 in my youth and uh i would also encourage\u00a0\npeople to to look around and try to try to see\u00a0\u00a0 uh try to help other people with eating disorders\u00a0\nbecause it's a serious problem in climbing and\u00a0\u00a0 not

So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising. One need to consume more, to grow faster and it's not without additional energy\nbut also additional pollution Meanwhile, temperatures and oceans are rising\nbiodiversity is shrinking and even if we're still looking a infinite, non-polluting form of energy we're realizing that it won't exist and that we are in big train which is speeding up into the wall of extinction. \u201cIt is my professional opinion that now is the time to PANIC.\u201d This is Boo.

(On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves.

Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential !

Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\".

As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising.

(On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field.

Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation.

To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave.

(This is the old set of an famous french tv show about science) Ha ! That's better (This is the classic set of the channel, black bg) ! So we can't rely on natural sources of electricity to ensure the massive and continuous production we need The solution, since we can't create energy from nothing, is to take another energy and to convert it. Solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy, fossil fuels or even biomass are the main forms of energy used and transformed into electrical energy. In addition, one must not forget chemical batteries for stocking energy but in other words: one can say we're pretty good with electrical energy... The issue is the energy demand is still rising. One need to consume more, to grow faster and it's not without additional energy\nbut also additional pollution Meanwhile, temperatures and oceans are rising\nbiodiversity is shrinking and even if we're still looking a infinite, non-polluting form of energy we're realizing that it won't exist and that we are in big train which is speeding up into the wall of extinction. \u201cIt is my professional opinion that now is the time to PANIC.\u201d This is Boo. Boo is a child and like Nutella once said in a french ad Children needs energy. In other words, a child contains energy. Thus one might consider exploiting children as a energy source. And of course, those people are monsters ... I mean litteraly. The future is bright at Monsters, Inc! We power your car, we warm your home, we light your city! Warefuly matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream. Refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on, Monsters, Inc is there. We're working for a better tomorrow, today ! We're Monsters, Incorporated, we scare because we care. \u2026 producing electricity with children's screams \u2026 ... ok why not. (On this part, the words and sentences are synchronized to the music, so it may pass very quickly) What is a scream ? We need to know that ! A scream is basically noise. So what is noise ? Well, it's sound !\nIt may be obvious for you, but I think we need to look at the basic vocabulary\nbefore diving into the physics of sounds, screams ... and roars. To generate a sound, air molecules vibrate quickly and transmit this vibration\nto one another, in fact a sound is a mechanical longitudinal wave. It means that molecules moves in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the wave and since they all take back their initial position after the wave we call that \"energy transportation without matter transportation\". We just need to get that energy. To make e-lec-tri-ci-ty, weeeeeeeeeeeeeellll we need to convert the mechanical energy \"inside\" the sound wave into electrical energy. As a matter of fact, we do that all the time \nand even right now ! all sounds system are constantly converting an electrical signal into sound waves, in one way or the other. Such as the microphones the speakers, the record players, \u2026 I don't have any examples anymore but that's ok we understand now that the door has to be like a mic. Of course, all of this must be invisible for the human world. To not raise any suspicion, we can't change the look of the doors. And as we're looking to get the maximum of energy out the the sound and so getting the wave on the entire surface of the door, an interesting solution would be to find a material in which we could make the doors. A special material which could convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. And this material exists and it's called a piezoelectric. It's pretty basic: you squish it, it zaps you. Okay so let's calm down and let's talk piezoelectricity. As we saw it, a piezoelectric has the weird feature of generating an\nelectrical charge when you apply to it a mechanical force but this also works in reverse : it generates a mechanical strain under an electrical field. It may sound a bit highbrow but piezoelectrics are very common and we can find them in a variety of daily-life objects.

Armed qith the malicious power of fire, the man can burn the evil on this land and make the world a better place. Same thing for a gas cooker ! I like the piezoelectric theory for several reasons. Firstly, beyond lighters, it's already used for sound systems such as mics and speakers, but very very thin. It seems relevant for our problem: we just have to cover the door with some piezo overlay and we would have our energy converter. The other advantage is that, the energy collection is integrated in the door, it could power itself ! Thus explaining how Boo's laugh can activate the doors in the epic third act of the movie, without being connected to the energy network. Hmm yes \u2026 because we only talked about screams for now but the fact that \"laugh is 10 times more powerful than scream\" is given to us at the end of the movie. So why ? Someone ? A human doesn't produce pure sounds but modulated ones. One doesn't generate continuous sounds, one emits sound intensity spikes quickly. In the case of a speech or a lauch, it is approximately 3-4 spikes a second. In 2015, a team of researchers, found that during a scream our vocal chords enter\na particular vibration regime provoking a very quick modulation of of the voice between 30 to 150 times a second, a phenomenon called roughness. Let's hear an example : Here is a continuous tone : and now the same tone but modulated to become rough. Aaaaaaaaah We could imagine that the vibration of the doors depends on this modulation frequency and a door would resonate for the low frequency of a laugh and not so much for a rough scream. Explaing how we harvest more energy with laughs! Then, we may discuss the inconsistencies of this theory with other facts in the movie: why Boo can power doors but also overpower the all network, how to stock scream in bottles then ? but one must know when to stop making weird hypothesis to explain imaginary things. That's it. I'm out of ideas. Because Monsters Incorporated is like dragons, magic or happy marriage it only exists in movies. Sorry. Well, it is possible to harvest sound energy, and with piezoelectrics, but it is so bad. Even with a sound power that would kill a bird, we could only harvest something like 0.01W/m\u00b2. For comparison, wind energy is 200 times more effective and solar energy is 20 000 times more effective. \"Human energies, 200 to 20000 times better !\" But as we explained, harvesting sound energy is more about harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations than sound itself, and with piezoelectricity we could do better than lighters. By using the vibrations of the environment after the passing of a train or the footsteps of people in a mall, we might generate enough electricity to charge small devices or power signposts. One could also imagine small connected devices such as a watch or earphones which would charge thanks to our moves. However with that idea, we only made the stupid snickers that light up when you walk ... but there is potential ! To conclude, we will never charge our phones with a scream, good news actually, and harvesting children screams wouldn't save us from the energy crisis, we're still in a sh*tty situation. I'm sorry this conclusion is a bit funk depression. Wait no I meant full depression ... What am I saying ? funk depression? ... funk dep... funk depression! We screwed the planet!
